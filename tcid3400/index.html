        <section class="introduction">
            <p class="mt-0">Minesweeper is a video game created by Curt Johnson. First released as part of the Microsoft
                Entertainment Pack 1 in 1990, it was first included in the standard install of Windows 3.1 in 1992,
                replacing Reversi from Windows 3.0. Microsoft Minesweeper was included without major changes in all
                subsequent <a href="#link-preview" alt>Windows releases</a> until Windows Vista, at which time an
                updated
                version by Oberon Media replaced it.</p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The goal of Minesweeper is to uncover all the squares on a grid that do not contain mines without being
                "blown up" by clicking on a square with a mine underneath. The location of most mines is discovered
                through
                a logical process, but some require guessing, usually with a 50-50 chance of being correct. Clicking on
                the
                game board will reveal what is hidden underneath the chosen square or squares (a large number of blank
                squares [bordering 0 mines] may be revealed in one go if they are adjacent to each other). Some squares
                are
                blank while others contain numbers (from 1 to 8), with each number being the number of mines adjacent to
                the
                uncovered square.</p>
            <p>To help the player avoid hitting a mine, the location of a suspected mine can be marked by flagging it
                with
                the right mouse button; however, if a player is unsure if a square is safe or not, they can tag it with
                a
                question mark (?). The game is won once all blank or numbered squares have been uncovered by the player
                without hitting a mine.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-0 mt-0">Windows 98</h3>
                <p>In early versions of the game, a cheat code let players peek beneath the tiles. By the year 2000, the
                    game
                    had been given the name of Flower Field instead of Minesweeper in some translations of Windows Me
                    and
                    Windows 2000 (most notably the Italian version), featuring flowers instead of mines. Flower Field's
                    gameplay
                    was otherwise unchanged, as was the executable file name.</p>
                <h3 class="mb-0">Windows Vista and Windows 7</h3>
                <p>The "Flower Field" version of Minesweeper, developed by Oberon Media, shows a garden blooming when
                    the
                    game
                    is lost. It is the default in specific distributions of Windows. The game's color scheme changed
                    with
                    the
                    release of Vista (from gray to either blue or green). The icons were updated to match the Aero look.
                    It
                    also
                    came with a "flower" motif (called "Flower Garden") as an alternative to the landmines (a game style
                    called
                    "Minesweeper").</p>
                <h3 class="mb-0">Windows 8 and later</h3>
                <p>Microsoft removed Minesweeper from Windows 8 and instead published it as a free game on the Microsoft
                    Store.
                    The new version is developed by Arkadium and is ad-supported. The initial release was supported by
                    30-second
                    video ads. Later releases had monthly and annual subscription options to remove the ads. Multiple
                    news
                    outlets criticized the change as greedy.</p>
